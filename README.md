# ConsoleInfo.js

The major browsers that used to style console.info have removed this styling. This, in practice, makes console.info practically obsolete, as it does the exact same thing as console.log.
**consoleInfo.js** attempts to bring the old behavior back.

## Usage
For usage in the browser, consoleInfo.js should be implemented by loading it before executing any other js, preferably at the bottom of the `<body>` tag.
